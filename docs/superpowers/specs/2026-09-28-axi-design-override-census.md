# axi-design override census

**Date:** 2026-09-28
**Subject:** `src/renderer/axi-design.css` — 2806 lines, 337 rules, 852 declarations, 68 `!important`
**Premise:** axi-design is the source of truth. Anything the app restates locally is drift waiting to happen; changes belong in the package.

## Method

Rules parsed from the stylesheet with comments stripped and line numbers preserved.
Each rule's selectors were decomposed into the classes and data-attributes they
target. Every target was then cross-referenced against (a) upstream's component
inventory at 1.15.0 and (b) actual usage in `src/**/*.tsx`. Nothing was left
unclassified — the unmapped set is empty.

## Totals

| Verdict | Rules | What it means |
|---|---:|---|
| **ADOPT** | 237 | Restates a component upstream already ships. Delete the rule, change the markup. |
| **DELETE** | 313 | Tailwind palette utilities repainted into axi tokens. Not upstream's problem — fix the JSX. |
| **EXTEND** | 59 | No upstream equivalent. Either add a component to axi-design or compose from primitives. |
| **KEEP** | 52 | recharts internals. Third-party DOM we don't author; has to be styled from outside. |
| **APP** | 13 | GW2 domain semantics. Legitimately app-side. |
| **(global)** | 28 | `:root` token remap, focus ring, scrollbars. The supported `tokens.css` mode. |

Upstream ships **52 component families** at 1.15.0. The app's markup uses **none**
of them.

## ADOPT — 237 rules across 13 families

Ordered by markup cost, since that is what the work actually is.

| Family | Rules | JSX sites | Files | Upstream target |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Modals & menus | 13 | 87 | 21 | `.axi-modal` `.axi-scrim` `.axi-menu` `.axi-drawer` |
| Tables | 44 | 64 | 13 | `.axi-table` |
| Cards | 21 | 42 | 12 | `.axi-card` `.axi-panel` |
| Shell & page | 27 | 37 | 13 | `.axi-window` `.axi-titlebar` `.axi-page` `.axi-mast` `.axi-eyebrow` |
| Switches | 15 | 19 | 5 | `.axi-switch` `.axi-pill` |
| Meters & bars | 16 | 13 | 6 | `.axi-meter` `.axi-bars` |
| Nav & tabs | 29 | 12 | 3 | `.axi-tabs` `.axi-accordion` |
| Buttons | 16 | 11 | 5 | `.axi-btn` |
| Tooltips | 5 | 10 | 7 | `.axi-tooltip` |
| Chips & badges | 13 | 9 | 3 | `.axi-chip` `.axi-pill` `.axi-sigil` |
| Search palette | 24 | 8 | 1 | `.axi-search` `.axi-menu` |
| Spinners | 4 | 2 | 2 | `.axi-spinner` |
| Checkboxes | 10 | 1 | 1 | `.axi-check` |

Note the inversion: **Nav & tabs and Search palette are 53 rules against 20 call
sites.** Highest CSS-per-component ratio in the file — the most reskin for the
least markup. They are the cheapest real wins.

Three of these are keyed on data-attributes rather than classes and so are
invisible to a class-name grep: `[data-nav-strip]` / `[data-nav-tab]` (4 rules),
`[data-search-pill]` / `[data-search-row]` / `[data-search-count]` (6 rules), and
bare `input[type=checkbox]` (7 rules).

## DELETE — 313 rules, 4568 JSX sites, 77 files

The largest bucket, and the one the "source of truth" principle does not reach:
the markup hardcodes palette colours as Tailwind utilities, and this file
translates them back into semantic tokens.

```
.bg-red-400,   .bg-red-500,   …  →  var(--axi-danger)
.bg-emerald-400, .bg-emerald-500  →  var(--axi-ok)
.bg-amber-400, .bg-amber-500, …  →  var(--axi-warn)
.bg-cyan-300, .bg-blue-400/90, … →  var(--axi-meta)
.bg-white,   .bg-slate-200/70    →  var(--axi-text)
.bg-black/60, .bg-black/70       →  var(--axi-scrim)
```

311 distinct utilities. The distribution is extremely skewed: **10 utilities
account for 2596 of the 4568 sites** (`.border` alone is 749, `.rounded-*` 426,
`.border-white` 292), while **178 utilities appear twice or less**. That shape is
good news — the bulk is a mechanical codemod against a mapping this file already
states, and the long tail is hand work.

This is not a migration to upstream. It is deleting a translation layer by
saying the semantic thing in the markup in the first place.

## EXTEND — 59 rules, no upstream equivalent

Each needs a ruling: does it belong in axi-design, or is it composed app-side
from primitives?

| Family | Rules | Classes | Question |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Bucket grid | 21 | `.bucket-grid*` | Pinned-column grid. General enough for the language? |
| Rail | 15 | `.dashboard-rail` `.bridge-rail*` | A sidebar/rail primitive — the most obviously reusable of the four. |
| Split layout | 13 | `.stats-table-layout*` | Split-pane. Arguably `.axi-page` + `.axi-grid`. |
| Mobile bar | 10 | `.mobile-action-bar` `.mobile-jump-chip*` | Responsive action bar. |

The rail is also the one that has already bitten us twice this week (the black
column, and `.stats-sections` still outstanding) — precisely because it is an
app-local restatement of "a raised surface" with no upstream contract behind it.

## KEEP — 52 rules

recharts generates its own DOM; `.recharts-*` never appears in our source. These
rules must live in a consumer stylesheet. They are the one bucket where an
app-side override is correct rather than tolerated.

## Recommended sequencing

1. **Switches** (15 rules / 19 sites / 5 files). Pilot. Needs **zero upstream
   change** — `.axi-switch` already parameterises width, height and knob through
   `--axi-switch-*`, so the half-size one is a variable, and `--axi-switch-fill`
   buys the danger state we currently cannot express.
2. **Tooltips, Spinners, Checkboxes** (19 rules / 13 sites). Small, isolated,
   proves the pattern across three more component kinds.
3. **Nav & tabs + Search palette** (53 rules / 20 sites). Best ratio in the file.
4. **Tables** (44 rules / 64 sites). Largest single ADOPT family.
5. **Tailwind codemod** (top 10 utilities first — 2596 of 4568 sites).
6. **Cards, Modals, Buttons, Chips, Meters, Shell** — the remaining ADOPT mass.
7. **EXTEND rulings** — four design decisions, upstream-side.

Also outstanding, independent of all of the above: we are pinned at **1.13.0**
and upstream is at **1.15.0**.
